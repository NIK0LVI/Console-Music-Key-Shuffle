Just a cute tiny app that pretty much shuffles around representation of musical keys. 
On the bright side, it could be used to try out random chord progressions,
however, it is not that great in depth. 

On the practical side, it was just a tiny project to try out shuffling in C++ using 
the Fisher-Yates algorithm, to shuffle a vector around. 
Oh, and to try out using colors in console apps, which in this case makes it pretty
much Windows only. 
Quite the hefty console description included!

It's also supposed to be humoristic. Key words 'supposed to be'. Might as well make 
practice fun, right?
